# UART-Transceiver-Implementation-in-FPGA
This repository contains the Verilog HDL implementation of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) transceiver on FPGA. 
The project includes:

Design Files: Verilog HDL code for UART transmitter and receiver modules.
Simulation: Testbenches for verifying functionality and performance of the UART transceiver.

The UART transceiver supports asynchronous serial communication, enabling data exchange between digital devices with configurable baud rates. This implementation demonstrates the fundamental principles of UART communication and provides a basis for further development or integration into larger FPGA-based systems.
